# ShortestPathPuzzle

You are given a 2-D puzzle of size MxN, that has N rows and M column (M and N can be
different). Each cell in the puzzle is either empty or has a barrier. An empty cell is marked by
‘-’ (hyphen) and the one with a barrier is marked by ‘#’. You are given two coordinates from
the puzzle (a,b) and (x,y). You are currently located at (a,b) and want to reach (x,y). You can
move only in the following directions.
L: move to left cell from the current cell
R: move to right cell from the current cell
U: move to upper cell from the current cell
D: move to the lower cell from the current cell

You can move to only an empty cell and cannot move to a cell with a barrier in it. Your goal
is to reach the destination cells covering the minimum number of cells as you travel from the
starting cell.
